I wasn’t supposed to touch the glimmering stones as they hung, but I would push up a chair and scramble on the rickety wood to brush them with my fingers anyway.

But that’s only if by “winning” you mean hunting down your opponent’s king until he is gasping for air in a solitary corner, his vision fading into the black and white static of the board as your opponent (John, Meera, or Jeremy) commits seppuku by resignation. Only gradually will you return to the hard seats and smudged tabletops of your school’s B-grade lunch counter. You will blink in a daze at the face of your opponent who, you must remember, is your friend in real life.', FALSE, 2, 8);

VALUES ('What Happens in Vegas', 'My cat, Oreo, is the best poker partner I have ever had. Hands down—no pun intended. Do not let those old Coolidge paintings fool you; dogs really do not know what the hell they are doing once you sit them on that rickety ladder back chair, and their paws just are not made for holding the cards steady.
